## Modern Times: Rise of Technology in Cinema

### Abstract
Cinema is a form of art that has blossomed in the 20th century and has nowadays become a major medium and a reflection of our society and values. In this project, we are interested in exploring and analyzing how technological evolution shaped the movie industry. This evolution can be characterized by events such as the inclusion of sound and color, the invention and use of atomic bombs, the space race and moon landing, and the rise of the internet and social media. We believe that we should observe a two-fold impact of technology on our dataset: one is on the technology used to produce the movies in itself, thus impacting actor careers and film genres; the other is technology itself as a narrative theme appearing in plot summaries. We seek to measure, through a statistical and data-centered lens, this cultural evolution. Alternatives ideas:
